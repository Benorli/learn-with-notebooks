# learn-with-notebooks
For all the notebookworms out there... 

## Reasons for starting:
- A lot of my favourite educators use notebooks as a primary teaching tool, e.g:
  - [FastAi](https://www.fast.ai/) and [Neuromatch](https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/tutorials/intro.html)
- I make a lot of notebooks to understand python libraries.
- I often use these notebooks as lookups to remind myself of how things work or reimmerse myself in library.
- I always found it easiest to learn Python libraries through notebooks.
- I love teaching and learning!
